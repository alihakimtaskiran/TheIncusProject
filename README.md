# The Incus Project
   A headphone is an escape from reality. When you upset, you start to listen a music then you feel relief. When you are in underground train, you seem to be felt scared; however, this not the case. Most of us listen music during the journey and we feel something depending on what is included in the music. Great accompanionship! This implies that hearing impacts out mood and it is very storng sense. The Incus Project renders this fact. It creates real like audio. By this way you would create your own reality and determine what you hear.
